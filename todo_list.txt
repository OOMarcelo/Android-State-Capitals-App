Next:
-implement game logic first (before making the game look appealing)
(see Game Play section below)
-fix the fitting of longer capital names (e.g. Oklahoma City) into button
-get image of each state
-high score (see final chapter of that book)
    --cite the book that helped me do this in readme

Game Play:
-GameActivity.onClick()
    --if GameActivity.mWaitingForAnswer == true:
        --if (isCorrectCapital(textOfTheButton)):
            --respondToCorrectAnswer()
        --else:
            --respondToWrongAnswer()
-GameActivity.respondToCorrectAnswer():
    --update UI score element
    --if (GameActivity.mScore < 50):
        --GameActivity.presentNextState()
    --else
        --GameActivity.respondToVictory()
-GameActivity.respondToWrongAnswer():
    --tell the user that the game will restart
    --GameActivity.restart()
-GameActivity.respondToVictory():
    --go to VictoryActivity
-VictoryActivity:
    --tell the player that he/she has won
    --have a restart button that returns to GameActivity and thus
    restarts the game

Considerable:
-making the states and capitals into enumerators
-putting a tiny time break in between correct answer and presentation
of next state
-making it more obvious that the correct answer has been given
    --could play sound effect
