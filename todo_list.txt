Next:
-complete the readme

On hold:
-high score (see final chapter of that book)
    --cite the book that helped me do this in readme

Considerable:
-making it more obvious that the correct answer has been given; could:
    --play sound effect
    --figure out how to make the phone vibrate
    --put tiny time break
    --have some words pop up
    --could have the text of the new state translate into the screen somehow
